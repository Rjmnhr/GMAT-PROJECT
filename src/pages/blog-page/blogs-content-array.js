          Let’s assume that you want to start-up your business in 5-10 years after your MBA. However, you don’t really have an idea or maybe have an idea that is half-baked. The fundamental question is for you to have an idea that solves a need and that someone is willing to “pay” for that idea. Obviously, the bigger need it solves and more willingness someone has to pay for the idea, the bigger the business opportunity. So, if you are really serious about being an entrepreneur, your focus should be entirely to clarifying, drawing, redrawing, editing and fine tuning your idea. Don’t worry about how it can be implemented. Focus more on what problem it solves, how is it currently being solved now, how your approach is better and who are likely to pay for your idea`,

Not all of these will help you immediately but they will start providing you with a framework to think. When you are thinking about an idea, you need to be aware of competition, supply and demand, willingness to pay, cashflow and financial models. It doesn’t matter what you want to achieve, these ideas will definitely shape your thinking. What an MBA also provides is lots of case studies so you can learn what others have done or not done and the mistakes others have made. This is invaluable for you to work through your idea to optimise your productivity and minimise re-work and loss.

          "Having said that, an MBA is also an opportunity for you to pause and ponder – having been on the run working on multiple projects and delivering outcomes for the last 3-5 years (sometimes even more), it is important to have a think about what comes next. Also, not a lot of us know what we want to be when we are in our 20s – rather that comes when we are in our 30s. That’s why what you wanted to be after high school might (and in lot of cases, will) change when you have worked for a few years in a chosen field of study.",

          It is alright to change your career goals as long as you realise that you can’t start from scratch – no matter what you do post MBA has to be supported by whatever you have learnt pre-MBA. And often it is not a bad thing. If you have studied science and technology, your skills in automation, project management, analytical thinking are things you take for granted but are skills that are immensely helpful in your post MBA career. If you have studied economics and finance, your understanding of business and how different functions operate at a grass root level will be very useful in a general management career.`,

          It is always good to have a skills inventory, pre-MBA. This will help you understand what career goals are achievable, how you can start preparing towards the goals and ultimately, make your unique life story realistic and well thought of. I always use a simple table to design skills inventory for my students and I have filled in one row for you.

          `If you want to start your business, an MBA in my opinion is quite important. However, what you need to realise is why I say so. Most people would respond by saying, an MBA will help me grow my network and when I approach funders, they will appreciate me having an MBA. In today’s world, an funder (private equity, angel investor or family offices) do not place as much weightage on an MBA as they do on your work experience, potential of your idea, your business model and team. All of these will be bolstered by your MBA but just having an MBA is not enough.
