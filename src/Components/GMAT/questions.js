This ecosystem is one of the fascinating paradoxes of the biosphere: how do clear, and thus nutrient- poor, waters support such proliﬁc and productive communities? Part of the answer lies within the tissues of the corals themselves. Symbiotic cells of algae known as zooxanthellae carry out photosynthesis using the metabolic wastes of the corals, thereby producing food for themselves, for their coral hosts, and even for other members of the reef community. This symbiotic process allows organisms in the reef community to use sparse nutrient resources efﬁciently. Unfortunately for coral reefs, however, a variety of human activities are causing worldwide degradation of shallow marine habitats by adding nutrients to the water. Agriculture, slash-and-burn land clearing, sewage disposal, and manufacturing that creates waste by-products all increase nutrient loads in these waters. Typical symptoms of reef decline are destabilized herbivore populations and an increasing abundance of algae and ﬁlter-feeding animals. Declines in reef communities are consistent with observations that nutrient input is increasing in direct proportion to growing human populations, thereby threatening reef communities sensitive to subtle changes in nutrient input to their waters.

      "(5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) Although genetic mutations in bacteria and viruses can lead to epidemics, some epidemics are caused by bacteria and viruses that have undergone no signiﬁcant genetic change. In analyzing the latter, scientists have discovered the importance of social and ecological factors to epidemics. Poliomyelitis, for example, emerged as an epidemic in the United States in the twentieth century; by then, modern sanitation was able to delay exposure to polio until adolescence or adulthood, at which time polio infection produced paralysis.

Thus, the hygiene that helped prevent typhoid epidemics indirectly fostered a paralytic polio epidemic. Another example is Lyme disease, which is caused by bacteria that are transmitted by deer ticks.

This evidence includes the discovery of organic molecules in ALH84001, the ﬁrst ever found in Martian rock. Organic molecules—complex, carbon-based compounds— form the basis for terrestrial life. The organic molecules found in ALH84001 are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. When microbes die, their organic material often decays into PAHs.

For example, ALH84001 has been on Earth for 13,000 years, suggesting to some scientists that its PAHs might have resulted from terrestrial contamination. However, McKay’s team has demonstrated that the concentration of PAHs increases as one looks deeper into ALH84001, contrary to what one would expect from terrestrial contamination. The skeptics’ strongest argument, however, is that processes unrelated to organic life can easily produce all the evidence found by McKay’s team, including PAHs. For example, star formation produces PAHs. Moreover, PAHs frequently appear in other meteorites, and no one attributes their presence to life processes.

Two years later, the McKay team announced that ALH84001, which scientists generally agree originated on Mars, contained compelling evidence that life once existed on Mars. This evidence includes the discovery of organic molecules in ALH84001, the ﬁrst ever found in Martian rock. Organic molecules—complex, carbon-based compounds— form the basis for terrestrial life. The organic molecules found in ALH84001 are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. When microbes die, their organic material often decays into PAHs. Skepticism about the McKay team’s claim remains, however. For example, ALH84001 has been on Earth for 13,000 years, suggesting to some scientists that its PAHs might have resulted from terrestrial contamination. However, McKay’s team has demonstrated that the concentration of PAHs increases as one looks deeper into ALH84001, contrary to what one would expect from terrestrial contamination. The skeptics’ strongest argument, however, is that processes unrelated to organic life can easily produce all the evidence found by McKay’s team, including PAHs. For example, star formation produces PAHs. Moreover, PAHs frequently appear in other meteorites, and no one attributes their presence to life processes. Yet McKay’s team notes that the particular combination of PAHs in ALH84001 is more similar to the combinations produced by decaying organisms than to those originating from nonbiological processes.

      "(5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) (35) (40) (45) Homeostasis, an animal’s maintenance of certain internal variables within an acceptable range, particularly in extreme physical environments, has long interested biologists. The desert rat and the camel in the most water-deprived environments, and marine vertebrates in an all-water environment, encounter the same regulatory problem: maintaining adequate internal ﬂuid balance. For desert rats and camels, the problem is conservation of water in an environment where standing water is nonexistent, temperature is high, and humidity is low. Despite these handicaps, desert rats are able to maintain the osmotic pressure of their blood, as well as their total body- water content, at approximately the same levels as other rats. One countermeasure is behavioral: these rats stay in burrows during the hot part of the day, thus avoiding loss of ﬂuid through panting or sweating, which are regulatory mechanisms for maintaining internal body temperature by evaporative cooling. Also, desert rats’ kidneys can excrete a urine having twice as high a salt content as seawater. Camels, on the other hand, rely more on simple endurance. They cannot store water, and their reliance on an entirely unexceptional kidney results in a rate of water loss through renal function signiﬁcantly higher than that of desert rats. As a result, camels must tolerate losses in body water of up to 30 percent of their body weight. Nevertheless, camels do rely on a special mechanism to keep water loss within a tolerable range: by sweating and panting only when their body temperature exceeds that which would kill a human, they conserve internal water. Marine vertebrates experience difﬁculty with their water balance because though there is no shortage of seawater to drink, they must drink a lot of it to maintain their internal ﬂuid balance. But the excess salts from the seawater must be discharged somehow, and the kidneys of most marine vertebrates are unable to excrete a urine in which the salts are more concentrated than in seawater. Most of these animals have special salt-secreting organs outside the kidney that enable them to eliminate excess salt. Questions 24–26 refer to the passage above.",

      "(5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) (35) (40) (45) At the end of the nineteenth century, a rising interest in Native American customs and an increasing desire to understand Native American culture prompted ethnologists to begin recording the life stories of Native Americans. Ethnologists had a distinct reason for wanting to hear the stories: they were after linguistic or anthropological data that would supplement their own ﬁeld observations, and they believed that the personal stories, even of a single individual, could increase their understanding of the cultures that they had been observing from without. In addition many ethnologists at the turn of the century believed that Native American manners and customs were rapidly disappearing, and that it was important to preserve for posterity as much information as could be adequately recorded before the cultures disappeared forever. There were, however, arguments against this method as a way of acquiring accurate and complete information. Franz Boas, for example, described autobiographies as being “of limited value, and useful chieﬂy for the study of the perversion of truth by memory,” while Paul Radin contended that investigators rarely spent enough time with the tribes they were observing, and inevitably derived results too tinged by the investigator’s own emotional tone to be reliable. Even more importantly, as these life stories moved from the traditional oral mode to recorded written form, much was inevitably lost. Editors often decided what elements were signiﬁcant to the ﬁeld research on a given tribe. Native Americans recognized that the essence of their lives could not be communicated in English and that events that they thought signiﬁcant were often deemed unimportant by their interviewers. Indeed, the very act of telling their stories could force Native American narrators to distort their cultures, as taboos had to be broken to speak the names of dead relatives crucial to their family stories. Despite all of this, autobiography remains a useful tool for ethnological research: such personal reminiscences and impressions, incomplete as they may be, are likely to throw more light on the working of the mind and emotions than any amount of speculation from an ethnologist or ethnological theorist from another culture.

Such guarantees specify what clients can expect and what the ﬁrm will do if it fails to fulﬁll these expectations. Particularly with ﬁrst-time clients, an unconditional guarantee can be an effective marketing tool if the client is very cautious, the ﬁrm’s fees are high, the negative consequences of bad service are grave, or business is difﬁcult to obtain through referrals and word-of-mouth. However, an unconditional guarantee can sometimes hinder marketing efforts. With its implication that failure is possible, the guarantee may, paradoxically, cause clients to doubt the service ﬁrm’s ability to deliver the promised level of service. It may conﬂict with a ﬁrm’s desire to appear sophisticated, or may even suggest that a ﬁrm is begging for business. In legal and health care services, it may mislead clients by suggesting that lawsuits or medical procedures will have guaranteed outcomes.

      "(5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) Seeking a competitive advantage, some professional service ﬁrms (for example, ﬁrms providing advertising, accounting, or health care services) have considered offering unconditional guarantees of satisfaction. Such guarantees specify what clients can expect and what the ﬁrm will do if it fails to fulﬁll these expectations. Particularly with ﬁrst-time clients, an unconditional guarantee can be an effective marketing tool if the client is very cautious, the ﬁrm’s fees are high, the negative consequences of bad service are grave, or business is difﬁcult to obtain through referrals and word-of-mouth. However, an unconditional guarantee can sometimes hinder marketing efforts. With its implication that failure is possible, the guarantee may, paradoxically, cause clients to doubt the service ﬁrm’s ability to deliver the promised level of service. It may conﬂict with a ﬁrm’s desire to appear sophisticated, or may even suggest that a ﬁrm is begging for business. In legal and health care services, it may mislead clients by suggesting that lawsuits or medical procedures will have guaranteed outcomes. Indeed, professional service ﬁrms with outstanding reputations and performance to match have little to gain from offering unconditional guarantees. And any ﬁrm that implements an unconditional guarantee without undertaking a commensurate commitment to quality of service is merely employing a potentially costly marketing gimmick. Questions 39–44 refer to the passage above.",

      "(5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) In a 1918 editorial, W. E. B. Du Bois advised African Americans to stop agitating for equality and to proclaim their solidarity with White Americans for the duration of the First World War. The editorial surprised many African Americans who viewed Du Bois as an uncompromising African American leader and a chief opponent of the accommodationist tactics urged by Booker T. Washington. In fact, however, Du Bois often shifted positions along the continuum between Washington and confrontationists such as William Trotter. In 1895, when Washington called on African Americans to concentrate on improving their communities instead of opposing discrimination and agitating for political rights, Du Bois praised Washington’s speech. In 1903, however, Du Bois aligned himself with Trotter, Washington’s militant opponent, less for ideological reasons than because Trotter had described to him Washington’s efforts to silence those in the African American press who opposed Washington’s positions. Du Bois’s wartime position thus reﬂected not a change in his long-term goals but rather a pragmatic response in the face of social pressures: government ofﬁcials had threatened African American journalists with censorship if they continued to voice grievances. Furthermore, Du Bois believed that African Americans’ contributions to past war efforts had brought them some legal and political advances. Du Bois’s accommodationism did not last, however. Upon learning of systematic discrimination experienced by African Americans in the military, he called on them to “return ﬁghting” from the war. Questions 45–49 refer to the passage above.",

      "(5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) In an attempt to improve the overall performance of clerical workers, many companies have introduced computerized performance monitoring and control systems (CPMCS) that record and report a worker’s computer-driven activities. However, at least one study has shown that such monitoring may not be having the desired effect. In the study, researchers asked monitored clerical workers and their supervisors how assessments of productivity affected supervisors’ ratings of workers’ performance.

      "(5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) (35) (40) (45) (50) Neotropical coastal mangrove forests are usually “zonal,” with certain mangrove species found predominantly in the seaward portion of the habitat and other mangrove species on the more landward portions of the coast. The earliest research on mangrove forests produced descriptions of species distribution from shore to land, without exploring the causes of the distributions. The idea that zonation is caused by plant succession was ﬁrst expressed by J. H. Davis in a study of Florida mangrove forests. According to Davis’ scheme, the shoreline is being extended in a seaward direction because of the “land-building” role of mangroves, which, by trapping sediments over time, extend the shore. As a habitat gradually becomes more inland as the shore extends, the “land-building” species are replaced. This continuous process of accretion and succession would be interrupted only by hurricanes or storm ﬂushings. Recently the universal application of Davis’ succession paradigm has been challenged. It appears that in areas where weak currents and weak tidal energies allow the accumulation of sediments, mangroves will follow land formation and accelerate the rate of soil accretion; succession will proceed according to Davis’ scheme. But on stable coastlines, the distribution of mangrove species results in other patterns of zonation; “land building” does not occur. To ﬁnd a principle that explains the various distribution patterns, several researchers have looked to salinity and its effects on mangroves. While mangroves can develop in fresh water, they can also thrive in salinities as high as 2.5 times that of seawater. However, those mangrove species found in freshwater habitats do well only in the absence of competition, thus suggesting that salinity tolerance is a critical factor in competitive success among mangrove species. Research suggests that mangroves will normally dominate highly saline regions, although not because they require salt. Rather, they are metabolically efﬁcient (and hence grow well) in portions of an environment whose high salinity excludes plants adapted to lower salinities. Tides create different degrees of salinity along a coastline. The characteristic mangrove species of each zone should exhibit a higher metabolic efﬁciency at that salinity than will any potential invader, including other species of mangrove.

Adenosine normally depresses neuron ﬁring in many areas of the brain. It apparently does this by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals that carry nerve impulses from one neuron to the next. Like many other agents that affect neuron ﬁring, adenosine must ﬁrst bind to speciﬁc receptors on neuronal membranes. There are at least two classes of these receptors, which have been designated A 1 and A 2 . Snyder et al. propose that caffeine, which is structurally similar to adenosine, is able to bind to both types of receptors, which prevents adenosine from attaching there and allows the neurons to ﬁre more readily than they otherwise would. For many years, caffeine’s effects have been attributed to its inhibition of the production of phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down the chemical called cyclic AMP. A number of neurotransmitters exert their effects by ﬁrst increasing cyclic AMP concentrations in target neurons. Therefore, prolonged periods at the elevated concentrations, as might be brought about by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, could lead to a greater amount of neuron ﬁring and, consequently, to behavioral stimulation. But Snyder et al. point out that the caffeine concentrations needed to inhibit the production of phosphodiesterase in the brain are much higher than those that produce stimulation. Moreover, other compounds that block phosphodiesterase’s activity are not stimulants. To buttress their case that caffeine acts instead by preventing adenosine binding, Snyder et al. compared the stimulatory effects of a series of caffeine derivatives with their ability to dislodge adenosine from its receptors in the brains of mice. “In general,” they reported, “the ability of the compounds to compete at the receptors correlates with their ability to stimulate locomotion in the mouse; i.e., the higher their capacity to bind at the receptors, the higher their ability to stimulate locomotion.” Theophylline, a close structural relative of caffeine and the major stimulant in tea, was one of the most effective compounds in both regards. (55) (60) There were some apparent exceptions to the general correlation observed between adenosine- receptor binding and stimulation. One of these was a compound called 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), which bound very well but actually depressed mouse locomotion.

      "(5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) (35) (40) (45) (50) Historians of women’s labor in the United States at ﬁrst largely disregarded the story of female service workers—women earning wages in occupations such as salesclerk, domestic servant, and ofﬁce secretary. These historians focused instead on factory work, primarily because it seemed so different from traditional, unpaid “women’s work” in the home, and because the underlying economic forces of industrialism were presumed to be gender-blind and hence emancipatory in effect.

      "(5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) (35) (40) (45) (50) Two modes of argumentation have been used on behalf of women’s emancipation in Western societies. Arguments in what could be called the “relational” feminist tradition maintain the doctrine of “equality in difference,” or equity as distinct from equality. They posit that biological distinctions between the sexes result in a necessary sexual division of labor in the family and throughout society and that women’s procreative labor is currently undervalued by society, to the disadvantage of women. By contrast, the individualist feminist tradition emphasizes individual human rights and celebrates women’s quest for personal autonomy, while downplaying the importance of gender roles and minimizing discussion of childbearing and its attendant responsibilities. Before the late nineteenth century, these views coexisted within the feminist movement, often within the writings of the same individual. Between 1890 and 1920, however, relational feminism, which had been the dominant strain in feminist thought, and which still predominates among European and non-Western feminists, lost ground in England and the United States. Because the concept of individual rights was already well established in the Anglo- Saxon legal and political tradition, individualist feminism came to predominate in English-speaking countries. At the same time, the goals of the two approaches began to seem increasingly irreconcilable. Individualist feminists began to advocate a totally gender-blind system with equal rights for all. Relational feminists, while agreeing that equal educational and economic opportunities outside the home should be available for all women, continued to emphasize women’s special contributions to society as homemakers and mothers; they demanded special treatment for women, including protective legislation for women workers, state-sponsored maternity beneﬁts, and paid compensation for housework. Relational arguments have a major pitfall: because they underline women’s physiological and psychological distinctiveness, they are often appropriated by political adversaries and used to endorse male privilege. But the individualist approach, by attacking gender roles, denying the signiﬁcance of physiological difference, and condemning existing familial institutions as hopelessly patriarchal, has often simply treated as irrelevant the family roles important to many (55) women.

      "(5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) (35) (40) (45) (50) Two modes of argumentation have been used on behalf of women’s emancipation in Western societies. Arguments in what could be called the “relational” feminist tradition maintain the doctrine of “equality in difference,” or equity as distinct from equality. They posit that biological distinctions between the sexes result in a necessary sexual division of labor in the family and throughout society and that women’s procreative labor is currently undervalued by society, to the disadvantage of women. By contrast, the individualist feminist tradition emphasizes individual human rights and celebrates women’s quest for personal autonomy, while downplaying the importance of gender roles and minimizing discussion of childbearing and its attendant responsibilities. Before the late nineteenth century, these views coexisted within the feminist movement, often within the writings of the same individual. Between 1890 and 1920, however, relational feminism, which had been the dominant strain in feminist thought, and which still predominates among European and non-Western feminists, lost ground in England and the United States. Because the concept of individual rights was already well established in the Anglo- Saxon legal and political tradition, individualist feminism came to predominate in English-speaking countries. At the same time, the goals of the two approaches began to seem increasingly irreconcilable. Individualist feminists began to advocate a totally gender-blind system with equal rights for all. Relational feminists, while agreeing that equal educational and economic opportunities outside the home should be available for all women, continued to emphasize women’s special contributions to society as homemakers and mothers; they demanded special treatment for women, including protective legislation for women workers, state-sponsored maternity beneﬁts, and paid compensation for housework. Relational arguments have a major pitfall: because they underline women’s physiological and psychological distinctiveness, they are often appropriated by political adversaries and used to endorse male privilege. But the individualist approach, by attacking gender roles, denying the signiﬁcance of physiological difference, and condemning existing familial institutions as hopelessly patriarchal, has often simply treated as irrelevant the family roles important to many (55) women. If the individualist framework, with its claim for women’s autonomy, could be harmonized with the family-oriented concerns of relational feminists, a more fruitful model for contemporary feminist politics could emerge.

      "(50) miss Thomas Paine’s point that “what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly.” In order for the far- ranging beneﬁts of individual ownership to be achieved by owners, companies, and countries, employees and other individuals must make their own decisions to buy, and they must commit some of their own resources to the choice. This passage was adapted from an article published in 1992. (5) (10) (15) (20) (25) (30) (35) (40) (45) While there is no blueprint for transforming a largely government-controlled economy into a free one, the experience of the United Kingdom since 1979 clearly shows one approach that works: privatization, in which state-owned industries are sold to private companies. By 1979, the total borrowings and losses of state-owned industries were running at about £3 billion a year. By selling many of these industries, the government has decreased these borrowings and losses, gained over £34 billion from the sales, and now receives tax revenues from the newly privatized companies. Along with a dramatically improved overall economy, the government has been able to repay 12.5 percent of the net national debt over a two- year period. In fact, privatization has not only rescued individual industries and a whole economy headed for disaster, but has also raised the level of performance in every area. At British Airways and British Gas, for example, productivity per employee has risen by 20 percent. At Associated British Ports, labor disruptions common in the 1970s and early 1980s have now virtually disappeared. At British Telecom, there is no longer a waiting list—as there always was before privatization—to have a telephone installed. Part of this improved productivity has come about because the employees of privatized industries were given the opportunity to buy shares in their own companies.

      "Questions 1–6 refer to the following passage, which is excerpted from Playing against Nature: Integrating Science and Economics to Mitigate Natural Hazards in an Uncertain World, by Seth Stein and Jerome Stein (Wiley 2014). Natural hazards are the price we pay for living on an active planet. The tectonic plate subduction producing Japan’s rugged Tohoku coast gives rise to earthquakes and tsunamis. Florida’s warm sunny weather results from the processes in the ocean and atmosphere that cause hurricanes. The volcanoes that produced Hawaii’s spectacular islands sometimes threaten people. Rivers that provide the water for the farms that feed us sometimes flood. Humans have to live with natural hazards. We describe this challenge in terms of hazards, the natural occurrence of earthquakes or other phe- nomena, and the risks, or dangers they pose to lives and property. In this formulation, the risk is the product of hazard and vulnerability. We want to assess the hazards — estimate how significant they are — and develop methods to mitigate or reduce the resulting losses. Hazards are geological facts that are not under human control. All we can do is try to assess them as best we can. In contrast, risks are affected by human actions that increase or decrease vulnerabil- ity, such as where people live and how they build. We increase vulnerability by building in hazardous areas, and decrease it by making buildings more hazard resistant. Areas with high hazard can have low risk because few people live there. Areas of modest hazard can have high risk due to large population and poor construction. A disaster occurs when — owing to high vulnerability — a natural event has major consequences for society. The harm from natural disasters is enormous. On average, about 100,000 people per year are killed by natural disasters, with some disasters — such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami — causing many more deaths. Although the actual numbers of deaths in many events, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, are poorly known, they are very large. Economic impacts are even harder to quantify, and various measures are used to try to do so. Disasters cause losses, which are the total negative economic impact. These include direct losses due to destruction of physical assets such as buildings, farmland, forests, etc., and indirect losses that result from the direct losses. Because losses are hard to determine, what is reported is often the cost, which refers to payouts by insurers (called insured losses) or governments to reimburse some of the losses. Thus, the reported cost does not reflect the losses to people who do not receive such payments.",

      "Forcing businesses to furnish employees with paid leave for family concerns, such as paternity leave or leave to care for a sick child, is a terrible idea. If a business allows employ- ees to take this time off, the workers will take advantage of the privilege and come to work as little as possible. This will destroy productivity and workplace morale. Which one of the following, if true, most seri- ously weakens the argument?",
    answer_1:
      "European countries guarantee employees generous family leave and paid vaca- tion time, but the European standard of living is slightly below that of the United States.",
    answer_2:
      "Most male workers refuse to take paternity leave even though it is allowed under federal law and their employers encourage it; they fear they may anger co-workers and harm their chances for promotion if they take time off for what is still seen as a frivolous reason.",
    answer_3:
      "The FMLA requires employers to grant employees 12 weeks a year of unpaid leave for family purposes; although employers save money because the leave is unpaid, they often must spend money to find a replacement for the employee who takes time off.",
    answer_4:
      "In some workplaces, the loss of a single employee at a busy time of year can be devastating, even if that employee plans to return after a few weeks; allowing family leave can overwhelm the employ- ees who stay on the job.",
    answer_5:
      "Allowing employees to take leave for family matters reduces absentee- ism, improves morale, and surpris- ingly increases productivity because the employees who are granted leave tend to work much harder and more efficiently when they come back to work.",

      "A new kind of primate, the fat-tailed lemur, has been discovered in Madagascar. These lemurs hibernate, sleeping in holes in trees for up to seven months out of the year. Winter temperatures in Madagascar rarely drop below 86 degrees, so these lemurs do not hibernate to escape the cold but perhaps to conserve energy during the dry season, when food is scarce. This is the first time anyone has found an animal that hibernates during hot weather, disproving the common belief that only ani- mals in cold climates hibernate. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the assertion that this is the first time anyone has found an animal that hibernates during hot weather?",
    answer_1:
      "The statement challenges the long-held belief that primates never hibernate.",

      "The statement calls into question the assumption that this behavior is true hibernation and suggests that it may be something else.",

      "Techniques At a gym there are three different paths an individual can take to obtaining membership. The first option is personal training. The second option is group fitness classes and the last option is individual direction. Members are only allowed to partake in individual direction after 5 personal training sessions and 10 group fitness classes. Personnel For personal training, there must be one trainer per individual. For group fitness classes there must be one trainer per eight individuals. For individual direction, no trainer is required; however, only 25 members can partake in individual direction at a time. At this particular gym there are 12 trainers. Price The price of membership depends on the technique the individual chooses. Personal training costs between $40 and $75 per session, depending on the trainer. Group fitness classes cost $20 per session. Individual direction costs $15 per visit.

      "In 2011, the Cornucopia Products Company (CPC) realized $100,000 in profits. Their 2011 customer base of 20,000 is relatively stable. Based on past trends, they can expect to retain that customer base in 2012. If they make no additional changes in marketing or R & D, then it is reasonable to expect their customer base in 2012 will be remain the same. Increasing their profits will depend on generating new customers either through successful advertising campaigns and or attractive fruits of research & development. The total customer base C in 2012 will be the retained customers plus any new customers.

In 2012, CPC has already allocated a small baseline budget to ongoing R & D, without any expectation that those results will bear fruit in this calendar year. Beyond that, CPC has to decide about whether to put more money from its 2011 profits into two ongoing projects. Project A has been in development for a little over a year. It is close to completion. The most reliable data about Project A suggest if CPC makes a $10000 investment in 2011, there's an 80% chance of producing a new product that would add 5,000 new customers in 2012; if CPC makes a $30,000 investment, there's a 20% chance of producing a suite of new products that would add 30,000 new customers. Project B is a relatively new product, involving some cutting edge technology. It's very expensive, and the results are uncertain. The most reliable data about Project B suggest if CPC makes a $40000 investment in 2011, there's a 40% chance that the new products would add 50,000 new customers in 2012.

      "We at CBO produce original programming for TV shows, mini-series, and movies. We sell contracts to television conglomerate networks for the exclusive right to broadcast our programming and sell them via DVDs. For this right, the television networks pay CBO substantial fees that help finance CBO expenses and fund future CBO programming projects. For members of the media, we provide kits complete with information on the actors / actresses in our shows, story plots, list of reviews, video clips and images. Now, however, some internet companies, through user generated content have not just a collection of video clips and digital photographs of our media programming throughout their site, but also full length versions of our movies and TV shows. Some of these users pirate our content and make it available for free via online video streaming just hours after initial release - this directly affects our DVD sales. Conditions must be placed on these practices, which go beyond basic media exposure; they harm the value of our contracts with television conglomerate networks and violate our rights as owners of the entertainment content. Video-based internet companies that wish to post such content on their websites should therefore sign contracts with the programming company that stipulate what content will be allowed and how much it will cost. As we have in the past, we will legally pursue internet videobased companies and push to have them shut down.",
